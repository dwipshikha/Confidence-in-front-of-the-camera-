# Confidence-in-front-of-the-camera-

Surely, overly self-confident people have an advantage 
when it comes to cameras. That's why we think it's 
absolutely okay to use help rather than continue 
struggling with sweaty palms, heavy breaths,and as a 
result, ridiculously awkward speech. Without further 
ado, here are the tips on how to be confident in front
of camera. 

* Probably the easiest way to gain a huge boost in 
  confidence is to practice in front of a mirror right 
  before going live. 

* Take some time to observe the way your body communicates.
  After analyzing your behavior, you will be able to 
  channel confidence on camera simply with the help of your 
  body. 

* Your health and mood, in particular, heavily impact the 
  quality of your stream. 

* Maintaining eye contact through the camera lens indicates 
  you are confident. 

* The importance of looks simply cannot be underestimated.
  Not only does a great look attrack more viewers, but it 
  can also makes you feel more confident, thus maintaining 
  those newcomers.
